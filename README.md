## Overview

The Black Hole Strategy is part of the MOFGalaxyNet initiative, aimed at optimizing the characterization of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) using advanced computational methods. This strategy employs graph sparsification techniques and inverse link prediction to reduce the complexity of computational models while preserving essential structural features.

## Features

- **Graph Sparsification:** Simplifies the initial network by reducing non-essential nodes and links, enhancing computational efficiency.
- **Inverse Link Prediction (ILP):** Uses Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to evaluate the redundancy of connections, identifying which can be removed without significant loss of network integrity.
- **Preservation of Network Integrity:** Ensures the essential characteristics of MOFs are maintained, facilitating accurate predictions of properties like pore limiting diameter (PLD).

## Results

- **Computational Efficiency:** Reduces computational load by up to 90%, improving manageability of the network.
- **High Accuracy:** Maintains prediction accuracy, confirmed through various case studies, validating the utility of the sparsification process in materials science.
