## Overview

The Black Hole Strategy is applied to the MOFGalaxyNet, which is a graph of MOF structures we previously developed. This strategy aims to optimize the characterization of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) using advanced computational methods, including graph sparsification techniques and inverse link prediction. These methods help reduce the complexity of computational models while preserving essential structural features of the MOF graph.

## Features

- **Graph Sparsification:** Simplifies the initial network by reducing non-essential nodes and links, enhancing computational efficiency.
- **Inverse Link Prediction (ILP):** Uses Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to evaluate the redundancy of connections, identifying which can be removed without significant loss of network integrity.
- **Preservation of Network Integrity:** Ensures the essential characteristics of MOFs are maintained, facilitating accurate predictions of properties like pore limiting diameter (PLD).

## Results

- **Computational Efficiency:** Reduces computational load by up to 90%, improving manageability of the network.
- **High Accuracy:** Maintains prediction accuracy, confirmed through various case studies, validating the utility of the sparsification process in materials science.
